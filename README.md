# This is my first time using github pages and it is pretty cool.
Learning git has been super interesting and I am glad it have it as a tool
#My Favorite concepts of git
- Commiting new changes and being able to go back
- Being able to fork other repositorities and help contribute your work via pull requests
- Creating branches so you can build/test certain ideas and not have it mess up the main project
